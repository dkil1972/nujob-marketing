<h1>Negotiating for Contractors</h1>
<h2>Get that rate increase on your contract extension. Get a better deal on your new projects and leave that 'market rate' behind.</h2>

<img src="http://www.smallnetconsulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/shutterstock_35261911.jpg" class="right" width="220">


<p>
  You want to charge a higher rates, but you don't know where to start.</b> You negotiated yourself the 'market rate' and tell yourself that your client can't pay higher for you.
</p>  
  <p> When a contract extension comes up, rather than negotiating yourself a better deal, you take the easy option - <em>you accept the same terms</em>; vowing to negotiate on the 'next one'. 
  </p>
<p>
  Most of us have spent years perfecting our technical skills. We know how to deliver a great user experience, a killer app, or solid code. Most of us haven't even spent a single hour learning how to negotiate.
</p>
<h3>What if you could get a better rate on your next contract?</h3>
<p>
  As a contractor, we find ourselves in a negotiation situation fairly regularly. Whether it is an extension or a brand new contract, there is a deal to be had approximately every 6 months. What would a higher rate mean? It's worth investing in  negotiation skills simply because of the  opportunity to benefit from it regularly.
</p>
<p>
Some of us know we are bad at negotiating and hate getting into the money discussion at all - we're glad when it's all over and we can get on with the job. This course aims to give you the tools to mak it go smoothly but still get a desirable outcome.
</p>
<p>Others think they are great at negotiating, some of possibly are! But do they know exactly what they are doing? or could they have got an even better deal? This course will show you what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong.
</p>

     “I thought I was a good negotiator. I can now identify times when I broke about 5 of the 10 rules and missed out a much better deal/rate. I now have to tools to be a GREAT negotiator.”

<p>If you haven't realised yet, the client gets to hire a professional negotiator (the recruiter) and you are expected to do your own negotiations.</p>

<h3>Are you worried that you might piss the client off?</h3>
<p>You should be worried, a good negotiator creates a win win situation. It is not about beating the other party, it is about making both sides. On this course you'll learn about the 'super win win' - this is the one you should always aim for!</p>
<p>
  The great news is you don't have to be a natural. It is a skill you can learn! It doesn't involve crazy levels of confidence, just a plan, a framework to follow (I know you love rules) and a little courage.
</p>

<p>
  What if you knew what clients were looking for? What if you had a framework for proposing projects at significantly higher rates than you're charging today? What if you knew how to respond to pushback?
</p>


<h3>What if you could double your freelancing income?</h3>

<p>Over the last two years, my course has helped over 5,200 freelancers earn more money for the same amount of effort. Like you, they became a freelancer because they wanted more freedom and flexibility. But too many of us just reverse engineer our previous salaries or use a "rate calculator" to figure out what we <em>should</em> be charging, and end up worse off than we were when we had a full time job!</p>

    “I was stuck in the mindset of focusing on myself and my price. After going through DYFR, I focused in on the value I could provide to my clients, strategies and tactics that could add $10,000 or $100,000 in revenue to one of my clients' businesses.”

<h3>What took me 3 years and $1,000,000+ in lost revenue to figure out:</h3>

<p>
  I didn't want to "push my luck". I felt that if I charged too much, I'd lose my clients... and I'd be out of work.
</p>

<p>
  Having worked with thousands of freelancers over the last few years, I've realized this is the #1 reason why freelancers are underpaid, struggle with cashflow, and end up more stressed than they ever were back in the cubicle. <strong>It's all due to fear and self-doubt. That feeling of: "I don't want to screw this up."</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2011/11/small-tech-we-are-titans-offer-west-coast-values" target="_blank">
    <img src="./Double Your Freelancing Rate_files/newspaper.jpg" width="300" class="right">
  </a>
As demand for my work grew, I started to build a team. Before I knew it, I had 11 full time employees working for me. This gave me a ton of exposure to a lot of clients and their projects.
</p>

<p>
  I started to really dig into why we were winning some projects and losing others. I began talking to clients and fellow agency owners to figure out why some people were, in my mind, "getting away with" charging significantly higher than their competition.
</p>

<p>Here's what I walked away with:</p>

<ul class="checklist">
  <li>Good clients don't always go for the lowest price.</li>
  <li>The price you quote is factored into your "risk profile", and if you can reduce risk through other means you can raise your prices without losing clients.</li>
  <li>How you position yourself and your services is everything. (Hint: Don't call yourself a freelancer!)</li>
  <li>Successful freelance consultants never negotiate on price.</li>
  <li>Cheap overseas labor isn't going to put us out of business, but it can if you're a commodity.</li>
</ul>


<a name="calculator">
<div class="calculator">
  <h3>What would raising your rates do for you?</h3>

  <div class="input-questions">
    You now bill 
    $<input type="text" name="rate" value="75">

    and work <input type="text" name="quantity" value="30">
    <span class="unit-label">hours a week</span>...
  </div>

  <ul class="results">
    <li data-multiplier="0.5">
      A <strong>50%</strong> increase in rates will bring you <strong class="green">$58,500</strong> more this year <div class="perk">(or 11 flights in business class from Europe to the US)</div>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>


</div>

<h3>I discovered positioning is <em>everything</em> — and raised my rate 500%</h3>
<p>
  I was able to raise my rates (and my team's rate) from $50 an hour <em>to over $20,000 a week.</em> And there's no reason you can't also.
</p>

<p>
  Once you're able to understand why people buy you'll be able to reposition your services and price in a way that is best for you AND your client. Here's the thing: No one has ever hired you for your design, development, marketing, writing, etc. skills. We often forget that clients don't really care about that, and we often make the mistake of selling that — instead of what clients really need from us.
</p>

<p>
  Clients want to understand how you're going to be an investment. They want to make sure that if they pay you that they make more than they're paying.
</p>

<p>
  This means you need to understand the problem behind each project. I like to call this the "proxy pain". What's <em>really</em> making someone willing to take out their checkbook and pay you?

  My comprehensive course is guaranteed to help you totally transform your business, or I'll refund you in full.

<p>
  If you're looking to really accelerate how you do things —&nbsp;including securing future income through high-value, low-input retainer packages — I've put together a premium program that includes everything I listed above and...
</p>

<ul class="checklist">
  <li><strong>14 video interviews</strong> with past students&nbsp;—&nbsp;totaling over 6 hours of discussion. You'll see exactly how each of my students has implemented DYFR, and what challenges and obstacles they faced along the way.</li>
  <li>The <strong>proposal and retainer templates</strong> that I use in my business (this will save you hundreds in legal bills).
  </li><li>A <strong>1.5 hour video course</strong> on writing proposals that close 2-3x higher than average.</li>
  <li>A <strong>private, 1-on-1 coaching and goal setting session</strong> with me.</li>
</ul>

      “Before DYFR I was happy to freelance at $100/hr for whomever. I worried exclusively about my code. Now, I'm walking up my price and running up my value.”

<h3>Where will your business be 2 weeks from now?</h3>

<p>
  <img src="./Double Your Freelancing Rate_files/books.jpg" width="180" class="right">
  Have you ever walked into a bookstore, picked up an interesting business book, flipped through it and couldn't wait to get home and devour it in one sitting... only to have it end up, unread, in a box in the attic?</p>

<p>
  After you sign up for Double Your Freelancing Rate, you'll immediately be sent the course materials —&nbsp;but you're also going to be hearing from me for the next two months. Every few days, I'll email you with additional content, insights, ways to apply the framework to your business, and I'll close each email with a link to an interactive worksheet for you to complete. (I read, review, and sometimes reply back to each submitted worksheet.)
</p>

<p>
  I want you to succeed. I want you to make a ton of money after reading the content and incorporating it into your business. <strong>And the only reason you've read this far is because you're unhappy with your rate, and know it should be higher.</strong> I'm going to help you do that.
</p>

<p>
  So what will you be charging two weeks from now? Is it what you've been charging for weeks, months, and maybe even years? Or are you going to charge more by delivering your clients a better product?
</p>

<h3>What happens after you buy the course...</h3>

<p>
  Once you signup for Double Your Freelancing Rate, you'll be sent the self-guided course book (along with the additional videos, training, and templates of the Complete Course if you choose that option).
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, you'll be sent an introductory email welcoming you to the course. And for the next two months, every day or two you'll get an email that walks you through one core concept of the course book, and includes an interactive worksheet that will help you apply the course to your business. I'll also have access to your submissions, and routinely followup with students with advice or feedback on their worksheets.
</p>

<p>
After I send you that first, introductory email your forum account will be provisioned for you and you'll be sent instructions on how to login. You'll want to introduce yourself to the community, and kick off a weekly progress thread so myself and others can help you toward becoming a high-value freelancer.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, after you've completed the two month course, you'll be invited to join me for a live office hours. In this session, I'll be able to answer any specific questions you have that are keeping you from fully applying the framework to your business.
</p>

<p>
<strong>I'm here to help you succeed.</strong> Are you ready to join thousands of other freelancers who are now getting better clients, winning more deals, and charging a higher rate?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px">Hi Brennan,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px">I am so happy I purchased this course.  The course book is awesome, <span>but I already see what makes this course so doable are the accountability emails.</span>  They are keeping me focused on the course and the material and reinforcing the key principals outlined in the course.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px">I am still a long way from where I want to be in terms of what I charge, <span>but I've increased by base starting point prices by 40% since starting the course.</span> I've been struggling with pricing for years, and I sincerely believe this course -- and applying what you are teaching -- is going to finally get me over this undercharge syndrome I've been stuck in for years!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px">Thanks so much much for the thought and care that you have put into this course.</p>

  <h3>Is this course for a specific type of freelancer?</h3>
  <p>
    Thousands of freelancers —&nbsp;designers, developers, writers, bloggers, and even lawyers — have successfully taken my course and are now charging more. I've intentionally left the course technology agnostic.
  </p>

  <h3>I'm just starting out. Is this right for me?</h3>
  <p>
    Many students tell me they wish they had this course when they started freelancing. The course breaks down any pre-conceived ideas you had about freelancing and why clients hire you. Think of this as the foundation of your business. You'll complete this course knowing why people hire and pay you, which will not only help you charge more — but it will also help you get more, and better, clients.
  </p>

  <h3>How does this compare to your other course, "Sell Yourself Online: The Blueprint"?</h3>
  <p>
    This course is the foundation that The Blueprint rests on. The Blueprint covers the strategies I used to generate the leads I needed to bring in over $100k of work each month for my agency. I recommend The Blueprint for students who have made the transition from commodity freelancer to high-value consultant after taking this course.
  </p>

  <h3>What happens after I buy this course?</h3>
  <p>
    You'll immediately be sent the contents of the package you purchased, along with an initial email from me. A few days later, you'll get your first accountability email, and they'll continue for the next two months. Each of these emails will contain additional insights and information, along with an interactive worksheet that will help you apply the course to your business.
  </p>

  <h3>I can't commit to the 60 day accountability course at the moment...</h3>
  <p>
    That's perfectly fine. Most aren't able to complete the followup worksheets in real-time. This course is sold on an ongoing basis, so if you can't complete the worksheets until later, my first email to you after buying gives you instructions on how to filter out my accountability emails and complete them when you're able.
  </p>

  <h3>Is there a way that I can read other reviews of this course?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. A few students have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16081159-double-your-freelancing-rate?sort=newest" target="_blank">left reviews on Goodreads.com</a>. Note: The current edition of this course was released in May of 2014, so any reviews prior to this date are for the first version.
  </p>

  <h3>How I'll make sure you're 100% satisfied with the DYFR course</h3>

  <p>
    The current course is the result of over two years of sales and hundreds of discussions with customers. If you're a freelancer —&nbsp;it doesn't matter <em>what</em> you do as a freelancer —&nbsp;and want to equip yourself with the knowhow to charge more, I designed this course for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've also recently taken steps to help ensure that each customer is kept accountable. I don't want you to pay me and that be it. I want you to pay me and make a significant return on your investment. So I've included a <strong>followup accountability course</strong> to help keep you on track and motivated.
  </p>

  <p>
    But there's rarely a "one-size-fits-all" solution to anything. So if you do buy my course, do the work, and get no results, simply send me an email for a <strong>full 100% moneyback guarantee.</strong>
  </p>
