    You want to charge a higher rates, but you don't know where to start. Maybe you negotiated yourself the 'market rate' and you tell yourself that your client can't pay more (hint: they probably can).
  %p
    When a contract extension comes up, rather than negotiating yourself a better deal, you take the easy option -
    = succeed ";" do
      %em you accept the same terms
  %p
    Most of us have spent years perfecting our technical skills. We know how to deliver a great user experience, a killer app, and solid code. However, many of us fall down when it comes to business skills like negotiation. 
    Some of us are blissfully ignorant, others think they are only 'ok' at it.  
    Some of us even hate negotiations altogether and would prefer if they didn't exist. These folk haven't even spent a single hour learning the basics. That's right, nothing! 
    And yet they expect to get the best deal for themselves when coming up against a trained negotiator (e.g. recruiter or HR).

  %h3 
    What would negotiating a better deal mean for you?
  %p
    As a contractor, we find ourselves in a negotiation situation fairly regularly. How much would a tiny rate increase multiply up to over the course of your contract? You only get one shot to get it right, and it applies to each day of your contract. Otherwise you will probably wait until your next extension, or new client. It's worth investing in negotiation skills simply because a few simple techniques go a long way.
  %p
    Some of us know we are bad at negotiating and hate getting into the money discussion at all - we're glad when it's all over and we can get on with the job. This course gives you the tools to become a good negotiator and to make a negotiation enjoyable while getting yourself a desirable outcome (and still keep everyone happy).
  %h3 But I'm already a good negotiator!
  %p
    Some people think they are great at negotiating, some of them quite possibly are! But do they know exactly what they are doing? or did they leave better deals on the table because they unknowingly gave something away for free?  This course will show you what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong so that a even a great negotiator can reach that next level of greatness.

        When I first heard about this course, I thought why do I want someone to teach me skills that I think I already know?
        I have done my fair share of haggling and my rates are above the market average, 
        but having explored the course further I found it was going to cover selling 'skills' as easily as 'products' and that it was going to approach the subject from a different angle, so I though I would give it a go. What surprised me about the course was how adaptable the topics were to each of individual situations and how it can not only improve your day rate and success rate, but also teach you how to come away from negotiations feeling good about yourself. If I were still in a team leader/pre-sales consultant I would recommend my team go on this course, now as an independent professional services consultant I would recommend all my customers go on the course, since as the tutor says it's a better game all round if you all know the rules and are playing the same game.

  %p If you haven't realised yet, the client gets to hire a professional negotiator (the recruiter) and you are expected to do your own negotiations.
  %h3 Worried that you might annoy the client?
  %p 
    Good! A great negotiator creates a win-win situation, not a win-lose. 
    It is not about beating the other party, 
    it is about making both sides win. 
    On this course you'll also learn about the 'super win win' - 
    this is the one you should always aim for! 
    You can create win-wins and be that great negotiator.

    %h3 What exactly will I learn on the course?
    %p
      You will learn how to be a better negotiator. You will learn to easily apply a framework to negotiations so that you aren't just making it up as you go along. You will get yourself better deals by using these techniques. 
      %b You will learn:
    %ul
      %li The 10 rules of negotiation
      %li The 5 phases
      %li The 4 Mantras
      %li The super win-win
      %li The Salami and the Jellyfish (I know...weird, but very very cool!)

  
  %h3 Can I really learn this? 
  %p
    You don't have to be a natural. It is a skill you can learn! It doesn't involve crazy levels of confidence, just a plan, a framework to follow (I know you love rules) and a little courage.

    %h3 What's included with the course?
    %p
      The main thing you get is obviously the full day's course itself. Led by Alan McCarthy. Alan has 35 years of negotiation experience and tailors the training to the group of people in the room. It's all interactive.
    %ul
      %li 1 full day's group training
      %li Practical and immersive sessions
      %li A copy of Alan's Advanced Negotiation Techniques book
      %li The training materials used on the day
      %li A full 100% money back guarantee
  
  %h3 How much is it?
  %p The full price of the course is &pound;499. However, if you're reading this, there is a better deal available to YOU.
      
  %h3 Is it a bit expensive for me?
  %p
    When you think about the reward, it's effectively free. The skills you learn can be applied in many contexts in addition to your contracts. You will recoup the cost of the course several times over. Whilst you are paying out for the course, it is like a risk vs reward, except 
    %b we'll eliminate the risk for you by offering a full money back guarantee.

        %h3 Tell me more about the 100% money-back guarantee!
        %p
          The guarantee is simple. If you don't make back the cost of the course within the next 6 months when using these techniques, you can have your money back. That's right, you win, either way!
        %p
          At the first training course, Alan offered the students this guarantee. We were also students on this course, that's why we are confident enough to also back that guarantee! Because we now know the techniques and know that they work, we're so confident that we can offer a 100% money-back guarantee.
  
  %h3 Why is it on a Saturday?
  %p
    To help you... since time is money. As a contractor you most likely have Monday to Friday contracts. If we ran it on any of those days, you'd need to take a day off your contract to do that. Whilst it would still be worth it, we understand that it's better not to lose a day's pay. The overwhelming feedback we've had is that Saturday is the best day to run it. It's good for us because we work Monday to Friday too (not to mention the option for drinks afterwards).
